							<h1>Digital Trace</h1>
							<p class="major"> Digital Trace is an application that enables individuals to see what data is available about them and others online. This is important as many people are not aware of how much they can be traced. Therefore, digital trace will give those a better understanding about the internet. Furthermore, the app will bring people together as they will be able to chat based on whether they swipe right. Individuals can choose to match with others based on their digital footprint.This will enable individuals to learn more about someone before they meet them. <a href="

							<h2>About</h2>
							<p>
The following project is based around data traces. Whatever we do, wherever we are, by living in a media-saturated social world we leave behind footprints of our media use that compile an archive of “digital traces”. This can be done when we upload photographs or write comments on the timelines of digital platforms, we leave an enduring imprint of our presence there.  Vice versa, sometimes we are unaware of the process as an unintended side effect of our media related practices. For example, when we are using a search engine, reading newspapers online or posting on Facebook. Digital traces have evoked a sophisticated and controversial methodological discussion that represents a new challenge to media and communications. The aim of the following project is to make individuals more aware about the online world. As although we often hear the term digital trace, many people have very little understanding of the plurality of the digital traces that we leave behind, or their social implications. I aim to demonstrate and help those develop an understanding that data is tracked every time you visit a webpage or an application

	<p>Internet traces can be used to identify links based on technical traces created by the many protocols used to communicate through the internet. Online illicit markets are hosted on web services and must use the domain name system to translate their domain name to an IP address that computers can understand. It is the practice by which data is collected about a person’s behavior online.

							<h2> Aim </h2>
							<p> 
The aim of the app is to promote a positive digital footprint and methods to reduce the likelihood of an individual’s data being misused. It will also be a useful source to help individuals stay safe online. The app will allow individuals to see what information about them and others is available to the public. It will allow you to look for information that is publicly available as well as information that is available to restricted groups such as, designated contacts or friends. Furthermore, the app will allow people to find the digital footprint of others. It connect people based on their digital footprint allow people to swipe right and chat.  Digital trace will help bring people together in a safe environment. 
</p>
<h2> Target </h2>
<p> The following project is targeted at everyday users of the internet. Digital Trace believes everyone has the right to understand and know what is avaliable about them online. Furtermore, it is aimed as those who want to meet more people as Digital Trace enables people to meet other individuals based on whether they have similar interests. </p> 

	<h2>Inspiration</h2>
	<p> The following movie, Searching directed by Aneesh Chaganty in 2018 is my inspriation for this app. The movie is about a man whos daughter goes missing. He files a police complain in order to find Margot however, a string of hidden truthes unravels when he checks her laptop. He does a digital data report on her and finds out everything. Searching has inspired Digital Trace app as it demonstrated how much about an individual is online.

<p> The swiping right of the app is inspired by Tinder. Tinder is an app that allows people to connnect by swiping right based on whether they like the look of the profile the person has created. Tinder is dangerous as the profile could be made up and actually not have any real facts about the individual. Digital trace will enable people to swipe right based on their digital footprint. This is safe, as you cannot hide any information on your digital footprint. Your digital footprint is often used to obtain personal information about you, such as, demographics, religon, political affiliations or interest. Therefore, digital trace will be a safe app to bring people together. </p>

						<h2>Definitions</h2>

						<p>
The investigation of physical trace evidence involves examining the remnants of the subject’s past behavior.

							<h2>Digital Trace</h2>

<p> Digital trace refers to your unique set of traceable digital activities, actions, contributions and communications manifested on the internet or on digital devices.

Digital traces can be intentional and visible. These include things like emails. Text, blog blogs, twitter posts, photographs, likes and posts on Facebook and Instagram. On the other hand, digital traces can also be unintentional and invisible for example, records of website visits and searches or tracking our movements and phone calls. This can make the digital world extremely dangerous. 

Through our everyday interaction we constantly produce digital traces, this is not only If we are online but also if we work offline on a word document.
